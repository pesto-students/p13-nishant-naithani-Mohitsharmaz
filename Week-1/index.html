      I'm Nobody! Who are you? <br />

      Are you - Nobody - Too?<br />

      Then there's a pair of us!<br />

      Don't tell! They'd banish us - you know!<br />

      How dreary - to be - Somebody!<br />

      How public - like a Frog -<br />

      To tell one's name - the livelong June - To an admiring Bog!<br />
